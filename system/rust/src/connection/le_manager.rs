//! This trait represents the lower-level operations
//! made available to the connection manager. In particular,
//! we can add devices to either the "direct" or "background"
//! connect list, which are in turn mapped to an appropriate choice
//! of scan parameters / the filter accept list.
//!
//! Note that the ACL manager is unaware of address resolution,
//! so this must be handled by the connection manager. Conversely, the connection
//! manager does not need to consider the HCI state machine, and can send requests
//! at any time.
//!
//! In addition to the supplied API, when a connection completes to a peer device,
//! it is removed from the "direct" connect list (based on exact address match).
